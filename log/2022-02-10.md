# Log/Notes
- diagnosing failing integration tests
	- (some quick docker notes)
	- pulling fresh `main` and clearing container fully
		- install npm packages in test
		- run all test <- some tests fail
		- decide what next
- try adding perf metrics of non-aot 
	- actually `time integration-tests` should be fine
- try 6.0.2; aot; build
- even w/ fresh build, test creds fail.
	- why??
	- reported as issue
- 8000 is ocaml backend server
	- no "add" route?
		- this was due to lvh.me thing
		- made dns 8.8.8.8
			- TODO: add this to readme


- running tests against _normal_ blazor (no  aot or upgrade) to get baseline. feels like 6.0.3 stuff was getting away from me
- running all int tests against non-blazor aot w/ timer
- do aot build
- run int tests again
- upgrade to 6.0.2
- try again


- abandoning hope on Blazor AOT.
- It seems I was confused when I thought it was working. Maybe I was running the non-publish - build, or maybe it _was_ working and I've since broken it.
- Not sure, but I'm past the timebox discussed, so moving on.

- spending 30mins on figuring out why integration test creds don't work for me
- ... somehow, after a fresh pull, the credentials work? no idea.

- onto making blazor the default, esp. focused on integration tests 
- most tests seem to be passing
- made blazor the default in the client, and tests naturally use blazor now

tracking some backend stuff used by integration tests
- backend/test_appdata is where data is stored
- backed refers to this in config.ml as testdata_dir
- testdata_dir used by `dir` helper fn for `root.TestData` DU case
- cavas.ml / load_and_resave_from_test_file uses Testdata...
	- [ ] TODO: look at usages^
	- I think that this creates a canvas for a test file
		- maybe every time it's saved?
- canvas.ml / save_test
	- [ ] TODO: look at usages
	- this seems like the more used, compared to above. likely the the one that happens upon tests getting initialized
	- uses save_json_to_disk_fluid - interesting
	- this creates a new test from some canvas you make in the browser. this takes in a canvas and returns a filename... that must be it.
- backend/test/utils.ml
	- doesn't seem super relevant
- backend/libbackend/webserver.ml
	- admin_ui_handler seems to be the thing that takes an HTTP request and returns a canvas based on the URL
	- [ ] Q: do we have any admin route stuff already working in F#? 
- backend/test/test_canvas_ops
	- t_canvas_clone is the fn I care about
		- 

Testresults

- LOL I just found where the integration-test stuff exists in fsharp-backend
- fsharp-backend/src/LibBackend/Canvas.fs has loadAndResaveFromTestFile
- maybe the integration-test flag somehow wasn't triggering things? studying...
- the api server
