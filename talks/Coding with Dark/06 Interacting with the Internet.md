    [3] Handling requests
        [1] Creating Endpoints, and Intro to the `HTTP::` module
            The `HTTP::` module provides functions to create responses to external HTTP calls.
            Each response function, such as HTTP::respond, creates a response value
                a response value returned by the handler will be sent as a response to the client

        [1] Setting HTTP Headers
            There are built-in header fns for commonly used headers, including authentication (`::basicAuth`, `::BearerToken`) and content types for plain text, JSON, HTML, and forms. Headers are dictionaries; to combine two headers, use Dict.merge

                `::basicAuth`
                `::bearerToken`

    [5] Hosting static assets
        Dark supports hosting your static assets.
        Our static assets service is designed to be simple, easy to understand, as well as composable and configurable. As such, a static assets deploys uploads your assets to our cloud CDN, and we provide powerful tools in Dark to serve and configure them.
        A GitHub Action to automate this process is available.
        uploading/deploy static assets
            go to https://dark-cli.storage.googleapis.com/index.html and download the appropriate binary
            `chmod +x dark-cli-linux` // to make it executable
            confirm it works with `./dark-cli-linux -- help`
            configure your client
                at the moment, our CDN does not support the use of absolute URLs is the generated files. For example, if your CSS file links an image at /static/myimage.png, that file will not load. You need to use relative URLs instead, in this case ./myImage.png
                Your index.html likely loads other assets, such as app.css or app.js. For speed, you will load these directly from the Dark CDN, not via your Dark handler. As such, we'll need to make some edits to your assets to ensure they're always pointing at the CDN for other assets.
                During the deployment of the assets, our backend replaces the string DARK_STATIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL in all of your assets with the actual URL of this deployment
                when not using a framework, prefix asset paths with Dark's magic strin, for example
                <img src="DARK_STATIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL/logo.svg" />
                In react, when compiing your react application, you can use PUBLIC_URI:
                PUBLIC_URL=DARK_STATIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL npm run build
            deploy
                To deploy, select the directory you want to upload. In this case, we'll use React's default directory `build`
                RUn
                    `./dark-cli-linux --canvas myusername-mycanvas --password '' --?`
                on success, we'll show you the deploy hash, a URL, and a long URL. THese are where your static assets now live! You can see your static assets in the Routing table in your canvas
            Set up your app to Load your Assets
                if your spa framework generates an index.html, or you write one yourself, you can load that for the / route in Dark
                Add a handler for / to load your index.html page using StaticAssets::serveLatest "index.html"
                If you're using client-side routing, you can also add a handler serving index.html for /:rest which will be a catch-all handler for any URL (besides /) that doesn't have another handler defined for it. This will allow your users to load your assets from any of your app's URLs
        using static assets
            StaticAssets::
                ::baseUrlFor
                ::baseUrlForLatest
                ::fetchBytes
                ::fetchLatestBytes
                ::fetchLatest 
                ::fetch <deployHash:String> <file:String> -> String
                    Returns the contntes of a file for the current canvas and the given deployHash
                ::serveLatest
                ::serve
                ::urlFor <deploy
                    Hash:String> <file:String> -> string
                    returns a URL to a file for the current canvas and given deployHash
                    ::urlFor "o6vs1aqcbs" "foo.html" -> "https://ismith-wlbtgta563t8/o6vs1aqcbx/foo.html"
                StaticAssets::urlForLatest
        implementing a fallback in the case of a 404
        if you're looking to serve a fallback asset, you can use a match stateuemnt:
        
        ```
        let resp = StaticAssets::serveLatest fileName
        match resp
          Ok resp -> resp
          Error resp -> "This is an error"
          Default -> StaticAssets::serveLatest "index.html"
        ```
