[5] Introduction
    What's Dark and what's it good for?
        Dark is a new way of building serverless backends. Just code your backend, with no inframe, framework, or deployment nightmares
        language, editor, framework, and infrastructure
        CRUD apps
            Get a working CRUD application in less than ten minutes by setting up a few API endpoints anda a datastore
        REST APIs and Webhooks
            Set up an API endpoint quickly enough to use it as a proof of concept during a call. Immediately see the data from a webhook to your endpoint. Call an external API using the HttpClient library and see responses within the editor, or use workers to do them in the background. Use the built-in backage manager to make external API calls really easily, and contribute your own API integrations
        Internal Tools and Bots
            Dark is ideal for quickly building slackbots and automating internal tools. Receive webhooks live, call out to 3rdparty APIs, store data, and schedule jobs
        the language being connected to the editor and infrastructure allows interactive functions
        Dark also includes HTTP libraries for interacting with external APIs, a package manager to make that even easier, and built in functionality for datastores
        dark being connected to the editor and infra allows for unique lang. functionality
    Making a really simple drive-by application
        idea: text a word, get a business idea, log them, list them
