- in vscode, some of the exposed ports don't have an obvious running process description. could we fix that?
	- 2345, 5433, 8000, 9000, 11000, 1080
	- also a bit unclear why we need bot h9001 and 9002 (apiserver), as well as 11001 and 11002 (bwdserver)
	- would be great to provide some quick insight
- is there a psql client in vs code that would be nice to install by default?
	- allow very simple access to the databases
- what lives on various ports?
	- 2345 - cloud_sql_proxy
	- 8000 - ocaml backend server
	- 5433 - postgres db
	- 9000 - F# api server
	- 11000
	- 80 
- what is a TLSavepoint?
	- todo: find note from paul on this and put it in docs or code somewhere
- release a Package in the Package Manager that lets you generate basic HTML to build a front-end. (just provide basic forms)
